# Obsidian Tabs

Thanks to the [Code Tab](https://github.com/lazyloong/obsidian-code-tab) plugin for the inspiration, but since it had not been updated for a long time and it wasn't support edit content directly, I refactored the plugin and added a lot of features.

> [!NOTE]
> **Please refrain from entering tasks directly within the Tabs code block.**
>
> The Tabs function operates based on the code block. In Obsidian, text within a code block is treated as plain text. Consequently, if you input tasks inside a code block, neither the tasks plugin nor the dataview plugin will be able to recognize them.
