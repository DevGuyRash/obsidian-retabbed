# Drag and Drop

After enabling 'Drag and drop' in the Tabs settings, you can quickly adjust the order of tabs using mouse drag and drop. Currently, drag and drop is implemented for tabs within the same Tabs component on a single page and between different Tabs components on a single page. Drag and drop between Tabs components on different pages is not yet supported.

Drag and drop is implemented by listening to drag-related events, so it cannot be used on mobile devices.
